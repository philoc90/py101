# In the previous exercise, we assumed that the Gregorian calendar has been in continuous use since the year 1. However, the Gregorian calendar wasn't adopted until much later; prior to that, much of the world used the Julian calendar, which observed leap year every 4 years.

# in 1752, England, Ireland, and the British colonies all switched to the Gregorian calendar. Update the function from the previous exercise so it uses the Julian calendar prior to 1752, and the Gregorian calendar starting in 1752.
