# Currently, our calculator asks the user for two numbers and an operation and then exits after displaying the result. Wouldn't it be nice if we could ask the user if they wanted to perform another calculation and start a new calculation when they respond with yes?

# There are several messages sprinkled throughout the program. Can we move them into some configuration file and access them by key? That would let us manage the messages more easily, and we could even internationalize the messages.

# Your calculator program is a hit, and it's being used all over the world! The problem is, not everyone speaks English. You now need to internationalize the messages in your calculator. You've already done the hard work of extracting all the messages to a configuration file. Now, all you have to do is send that configuration file to translators and call the right translation in your code.

# Currently, our calculator only handles integer inputs. Let's modify it to accept floating-point numbers as well.
